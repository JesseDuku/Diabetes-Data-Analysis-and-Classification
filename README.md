# Diabetes-Data-Analysis-and-Classification
This repository contains code and resources for the Diabetes Data Analysis and Classification project.
The project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to diabetes and building classification models to predict diabetes presence based on various features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of  e.g., age,gender, hypertension, smoking histort BMI, glucose levels, etc.].
The code provided in this repository demonstrates the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features.

Exploratory data analysis: Various visualizations and descriptive statistics are utilized to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables.

Classification models: Three classification models are implemented:

Logistic Regression: A logistic regression model is trained to predict the presence of diabetes.
Naive Bayes: A naive Bayes classifier is used to build a diabetes prediction model.
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A KNN classifier is employed to classify instances as having diabetes or not.
Model evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy score on a test set.

Instructions
To reproduce the analysis and classification models:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary dependencies 

Run the code in your preferred Python environment or IDE, ensuring that the dataset and code files are in the same directory.

Modify the code as needed or experiment with different parameters to further improve the models.

Results
The results of the analysis and classification models are as follows:

Logistic Regression: accuracy score of 0.96055
Naive Bayes: accuracy score of 0.9025
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):  accuracy score of 0.96205
